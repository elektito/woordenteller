# Nederlandse Woordenteller

The _Nederlandse Woordenteller_ (Dutch Word Counter) is a tiny web
application to help you keep track of the words you've learned. Simply
enter words, phrases or sentences you know and it will keep track of
the new words. [Frog][1] is used to extract the word roots, so for
example "boeken" and "boek" are not counted as separate words.
